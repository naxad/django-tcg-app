          <h5 class="mt-4">8. Pre-Orders</h5>

          <h5 class="mt-4">9. Returns & Refunds — Singles</h5>
          <p>No returns or refunds for single cards <strong>unless</strong> the card received is not as described in condition or identity, or was damaged before dispatch. You must contact us within 48 hours of delivery and provide:</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4">10. Returns & Refunds — Sealed Products</h5>
          <p>No returns for change of mind. Refunds are only issued if you receive the wrong item or a product that is damaged upon arrival. We are not liable for how shipping carriers handle packages. Minor box dents that don’t break the factory seal are not considered damage.</p>

          <p>AI grading results are approximate and provided for informational purposes only. Grades may differ from third-party graders (PSA, CGC, Beckett, etc.). We do not guarantee consistency and in no way we promise that you will receive the same grade when officially submitting.</p>
